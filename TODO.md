# Entry merging and extending #

Chumsdock suggested we should be able to merge entries since some entries may refer to the same word just with different pronunciations, it's a typical situation.

To think further about that, we might also need to give multiple index to the same entry, for example, we may want to refer to "give" and "gave"  and "give" in the same entry.

To summarize, we need a flexible way to specify which entry need to be merged and which entry should have multiple index.
